## Lab 4 Redux Blog Frontend

The assignment is found at
	`http://cs52.me/assignments/lab/redux-blog/`

The site is deployed at
	`thekevhuLab4.surge.sh`

### What worked

After the lab, I have a good understanding of the component action reducer flow. 

### What didn't work for me

I am a little confused about the asynch functions in Actions and the role of thunk. I am slightly confused on some of the lifecycle functions and when it is neccessary to use them and when it is just a duplicate and unneccesary.  

### Extra Credit

The app checks fields and won't let a user create a new post until all fields are filled in.
